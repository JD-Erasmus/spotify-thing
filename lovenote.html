        I created this for you because it brings together some of my greatest passions: music, making stuff, and most importantly, you. 
        Every song on this list has made me pause and think of you. Some songs remind me of moments we've shared, and I want you to know just how much you mean to me.
    </p>
    <p>
        I may not always find the right words to express how deeply I feel, but when I listen to these songs, they bring everything rushing to the surface. 
        Each track, each note, carries a piece of my heart, an emotion, a thought, a feeling that’s too big to say aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
        Songs like <strong>"The Middle"</strong> will always be your song in my mind. And <strong>"Tiny Dancer"</strong>—I still remember the moment it played in Marua Mall; 
        I had to make it extra special and point it out. The song is always a vibe with you. I enjoy it more when you're around.

    <p>
        Then there’s <strong>"Lenie Blou"</strong>, which reminds me of LiefdeByDieNam,(I am so happy to share that moment with you) and <strong>"Dagdrome in Suburbia"</strong>, especially the part that goes 
        <em>"Ek het jou gesien"</em>. I always sing that part extra loud because it makes me think of you. And of course, <strong>"Fok Vrou"</strong>—jy weet mos...

            So Fok Vrou<br>
            As jy eendag als vergeet dan sal ek jou daagliks vertel<br>
            Van ons<br>
            Daar's tye in die hemel en daar's tye in die hel<br>
            Fok vrou<br>
            As jy eendag als vergeet dan sal ek jou daagliks vertel<br>
            Dat jy<br>
            Die beste mens is wie ek ken want jy's my beste pel

        And from Mac Miller’s <strong>"Surf"</strong>: 
    </p>
    <div>
        <blockquote>
            Where are you goin'? Can I come too?<br>
            The whole world is open, a playground for me and you<br>
            And we could be fine, shit, who the hell knows?<br>
            It's your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your nose<br>
            Head and your shoulders, your knees and your toes
        </blockquote>

        Naatuurlik hoef ek "FLVJ" nie te verduidelik nie, want "Ek is Fokken Lief Vir Jou."
    </p>
    <p>
        Happy birthday, my love. With all my heart, <br> ~ I love you.
