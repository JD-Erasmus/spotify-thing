            I’m not one to use many words, and sometimes I find it difficult to express just how deeply I feel. But even though words may fall short, I hope these songs can say what I struggle to put into speech. Each track, each note, carries a part of what’s in my heart—an emotion, a thought, a feeling that’s too big for me to say aloud.

            These songs are my way of trying to show you just how much you mean to me. Each one comes close to capturing a piece of how I feel, even if words can’t fully express the depth of it. I may not always know how to say it, but when I listen to these songs, I’m reminded of you, and everything I feel comes rushing to the surface.

            I want to let you know that, even in my quietest moments, you are always there—beautiful, constant, and unforgettable.
        </p>

            With all my heart,
